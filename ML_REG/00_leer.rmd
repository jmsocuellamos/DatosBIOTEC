ml_reg_02.csv       |   An experiment was conducted to compare yields (measured by dried weight of plants) under a control condition and two different treatment conditions. (Table 6.6 Dobson).
ml_reg_03.csv       |   Data shows the average apparent per capita consumption ofsuga r (in kg per year) in Australia, as refined sugar and in manufactured foods (from Australian Bureau ofStatistics, 1998). (Table 6.15 Dobson).
