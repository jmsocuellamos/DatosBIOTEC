Seeds																
																
Seeds of a particular crop were stored at four different temperatures (T1, T2, T3, and T4) under four 
different chemical concentrations (0, 0.1, 1.0, and 10). To study the effects of temperature and 
chemical concentration, a completely randomized experiment was conducted with a factorial treatment structure 
4 × 4 and four replicates. For each of the 64 experimental units, 50 seeds were placed in a dish and the number 
of seeds that germinated under standard conditions was recorded.																
																
														
trees																
																
Data were obtained from an experiment in which separate sprouts of apple trees were inoculated with macroconidia of 
the fungus Nectria galligena, which causes apple cancer (canker gangrene). The experimental factors were inoculum density (
three levels: 200, 1000, and 5000 macroconidia per ml) and variety (three levels: Jonagold, Golden Delicious, and Jonathan). 
The experiment was carried out in 4 randomized blocks with 12 plots. Each plot consisted of one sprout on which five inoculations 
were made. The numbers of successful inoculations per plot on day 17 after inoculation are shown in the table below																
																		
																
protoplasts																
																
This experiment concerns the germination efficiencies of protoplasts obtained from plants of seven species of the genera 
Lycopersicon (tomato) and Solanum (potato). For each species, three or four protoplast isolates were used and, depending 
on the availability of the protoplasts, a variable number of plates was carried out. Per plate, approximately 105 protoplasts 
were placed in a Petri dish, and, after 4 weeks, the proportion of dividing protoplasts was recorded. The results in percentages 
are listed below																
																																
greenhouse																
																
A greenhouse experiment was carried out to investigate how a disease spreads in two varieties of (agurkesyge) cucumber, 
which is supposed to depend on the climate and the amount of fertilizers used for the two varieties. The following data come 
from the Department of Plant Pathology. Two climates were used: (1) change to day temperature 3 hours before sunrise and (2) 
normal change to day temperature. Three amounts of fertilizer were applied, normal (2.0 units), high (3.5 units), and very 
high (4.0 units). The two varieties were Aminex and Dalibor. To have a better controlled experiment, the plants were “standardized” 
to equally have as many leaves, and, then (on day 0, for example), the plants were contaminated with the disease. Subsequently, 
8 days after the plants were contaminated, the amount of infection (in percentage) was recorded. From the resulting infection curve, 
two measures were calculated (in a manner not specified here), namely, the rate of spread of the disease (%) and the level of 
infection at the end of the disease period. The experiment was implemented in three blocks, each of which consisted of two sections. 
Each section consisted of three plots, which were divided into two subplots, each of which had six to eight plants. Thus, there were 
a total of 36 subplots. The results were recorded for each subplot. The experimental factors were randomly assigned to the different 
units as follows: two climates to the two sections within each block, three amounts of fertilizer to the three plots within each section, 
and, finally, the two varieties to the two subplots within each plot. The data are shown below
