glm_multi_01.csv       |   In a study ofmotor vehicle safety, men and women driving small, medium sized and large cars were interviewed about vehicle safety and their preferences for cars, and various measurements were made of how close they sat to the steering wheel (McFadden et al., 2000). They were asked to rate how important various features were to them when they were buying a car. Data table shows the ratings for air conditioning and power steering, according to the sex and age ofthe subject (the categories ‘not important’ and ‘of little importance’ have been combined). (Table 8.1 Dobson).
glm_multi_02.csv       |   The data are from an investigation into satisfaction with housing conditions in Copenhagen (derived from Example W in Cox and Snell, 1981, from original data from Madsen, 1971). Residents in selected areas living in rented homes built between 1960 and 1968 were questioned about their satisfaction and the degree of contact with other residents. The data were tabulated by type ofhousing. (Table 8.5 Dobson).
glm_multi_03.csv       |   The data show tumor responses of male and female patients receiving treatment for small-cell lung cancer. There were two treatment regimes. For the sequential treatment, the same combination ofc hemotherapeutic agents was administered at each treatment cycle. For the alternating treatment, different combinations were alternated from cycle to cycle (data from Holtbrugger and Schumacher, 1991). (Table 8.6 Dobson).
glm_multi_04.csv       |   The data are from a famous study conducted by Sir Richard Doll and colleagues. In 1951, all British doctors were sent a brief questionnaire about whether they smoked tobacco. Since then information about their deaths has been collected. Table shows the numbers ofdeath s from coronary heart disease among male doctors 10 years after the survey. It also shows the total number ofp erson-years ofobserv ation at the time ofthe analysis (Breslow and Day, 1987: Appendix 1A and page 112). (Table 9.1 Dobson).
glm_multi_05.csv       |   These data are from a cross-sectional study of patients with a form of skin cancer called malignant melanoma. For a sample of n = 400 patients, the site ofthe tumor and its histological type were recorded. (Table 9.4 Dobson).
glm_multi_06.csv       |   In a prospective study ofa new living attenuated recombinant vaccine for influenza, patients were randomly allocated to two groups, one of whic h was given the new vaccine and the other a saline placebo. The responses were titre levels of hemagglutinin inhibiting antibody found in the blood six weeks after vaccination; they were categorized as ‘small’, ‘medium’ or ‘large’.(Table 9.6 Dobson).
glm_multi_07.csv       |  In this retrospective case-control study a group ofulcer patients was compared to a group ofcon trol patients not known to have peptic ulcer, but who were similar to the ulcer patients with respect to age, sex and socio-economic status. The ulcer patients were classified according to the site ofthe ulcer: gastric or duodenal. Aspirin use was ascertained for all subjects.  (Table 9.7 Dobson).
