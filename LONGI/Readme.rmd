There were three experimental groups: A was a new occupational therapy intervention; B was the existing stroke rehabilitation program conducted in the same hospital where A was conducted; C was the usual care regime for stroke patients provided in a different hospital.  There were eight patients in each experimental group. The response variable was a measure off unctional ability, the Bartel index; higher scores correspond to better outcomes and the maximum score is 100.
